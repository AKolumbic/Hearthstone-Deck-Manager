# Hearthstone-Deck-Manager

The goal of this project is to make an emulator of Hearthstone's Deck Manager using the MERN stack. Inspired by Day9TV's 30 Day Project Challenge, I choose to build this because of my love and knowledge of Hearthstone, and a desire to work on a more sophistaced fullstack app in my post-Lambda-School life.
